# Learning Folder

This directory contains all learning exercises, experiments, and practice modules created during the development of **TestLang++**, a custom domain-specific language (DSL) that generates Java-based JUnit tests for REST APIs.

Each subfolder represents a focused learning milestone — helping to gradually build the knowledge and components required for the main project.

---

## Purpose
The goal of this folder is to:
- Understand key compiler-building concepts step-by-step.
- Experiment safely before integrating code into the main project.
- Document each learning stage with examples and notes.

## Folder Structure

| Folder | Description |
|---------|--------------|
| **jflex_basics/** | Simple example to learn how lexers work and how JFlex tokenizes identifiers, numbers, and strings. |
